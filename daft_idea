Idea for Python project

The general idea is to scrape data from Daft.ie and Funda.nl to provide insights
about the housing market, predict prices and explore differences between Dublin
and Amsterdam. Also good opportunity to show attractive graphs.

Steps
1 Scrape data from Daft.ie and Funda.nl for Dublin and Amsterdam, gathering as
  much data as possible that could be used as features
2 Gather coordinates from the ads. These are hidden in the html code of both
  websites. (ctrl-U and search)
3 Match these coordinates with open street maps. This allows plotting the
  locations of the houses on a map, as well as matching it to other data
  available on open street maps
4 Use the open street maps API to gather additional info, such as the number of
  schools and hospitals in the area. (amenities, buildings, leisure)
  See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features for an overview.
5 Fit a model that predicts house price and find out what the city effect is
  and also interesting on its own what the effect is of nearby amenities.

Example from http://overpass-turbo.eu/ that returns a file with amenity=school
and amenity=pub. Counting the number of occurances in the text results in the
number of amenities within a 1 km radius around the location.

  node["amenity"="school"](around:1000,53.309652,-6.254164);
  way["amenity"="school"](around:1000,53.309652,-6.254164);
  relation["amenity"="school"](around:1000,53.309652,-6.254164);
  node["amenity"="pub"](around:1000,53.309652,-6.254164);
  way["amenity"="pub"](around:1000,53.309652,-6.254164);
  relation["amenity"="pub"](around:1000,53.309652,-6.254164);
);
// print results

out skel qt;

Another example locating LUAS stops
